### Note
This post is (very) work-in-progress, and I'll be coming back to it over time to talk more about these games under their respective headings. I just like having this post exist here so I have a place I can go to write about them when I feel like it.

As a game developer, a lot of people like to ask me about my favorite games ever. Luckily for them, I really like ranking things and thinking about how I would rank things, so I already have a list I can show them!  
For what it's worth, these are by no means the games that I think are the *greatest* ever, but rather my all-time favorites. I think the vast majority of these belong on any reasonable greatest games of all time list, though probably not in this order (I don't even think lists like that should really be linearly ranked)
and with additional entries that I have played but don't come close to being on this list (Hades, Minecraft, Skyrim, Breath of the Wild, The Last of Us, etc.).

## The List

1. **Disco Elysium**  
2. **Planescape\: Torment**
3. **Cyberpunk 2077**  
4. **Batman\: Arkham City**
5. **Titanfall 2**
6. **Fallout\: New Vegas**
7. **Mass Effect 3**  
8. **Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II\: The Sith Lords**  
9. **Command \& Conquer\: Red Alert 2**

11. **Batman\: Arkham Knight**  
12. **Wolfenstein\: The New Order**  
13. **Mass Effect 2**  
14. **Splinter Cell\: Chaos Theory**  
15. **Torment\: Tides of Numenera**  
16. **S.T.A.L.K.E.R.\: Shadow of Chernobyl**
17. **Call of Duty\: Modern Warfare 2**  
18. **Vampire\: The Masquerade -- Bloodlines**
19. **Sly 2\: Band of Thieves**
20. **Dragon Age\: Origins**
